## Mantaro's API

This handles all of [Mantaro's](https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot) games and works as a bridge between the different instances of the bot to get shared data

Usually this includes
- Splashes
- Pokemon Game
- Character Game
- "Hush" / Secret Achievements
- Patreon handling (Receive pledge data, refresh pledges)


The rest of the inter-node and inter-bot communication is done in Redis.
